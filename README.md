## Reproducibility


This repository is organized as a reproducible research compendium. 
Click the ![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg) button above to explore in an interactive RStudio session.   Binder uses [rocker-project.org](https://rocker-project.org) Docker images to ensure a consistent and reproducible computational environment.  These Docker images can also be used locally.  

To explore the code locally, clone or download this repository into RStudio or your perferred environment and install the compendium by running `devtools::install()`.  To install additional dependencies used only in formatting the figures, use `devtools::install(dep=TRUE)`.
